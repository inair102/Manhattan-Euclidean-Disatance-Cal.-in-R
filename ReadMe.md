#Manhattan Distance:- 
The distance between two points in a grid based on a strictly horizontal and/or vertical path (that is, along the grid lines), as opposed to the diagonal or "as the crow flies" distance. The Manhattan distance is the simple sum of the horizontal and vertical components, whereas the diagonal distance might be computed by applying the Pythagorean theorem.

#Euclidean Distances:- 
The distance between two points in the plane with coordinates (x, y) and (a, b) is given by

dist((x, y), (a, b)) = ?(x - a)² + (y - b)²
(This is for two dimensions.)
